											If you wish to purchase any product or service made available through the Services ("Purchase"), you may be asked to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase, without limitation.

Without notice, we may change the price and availability of virtual Items. All purchases/redemptions of virtual items made through the Services are final and non-refundable. You acknowledge and consent that the provision of virtual items for use in the Services is a process that commences immediately upon purchase. Therefore, you lose your right of cancelation once the process has commenced. You agree that we are not required to provide a refund for virtual items for any reason. You further acknowledge that you will not receive money/compensation for unused virtual items, regardless of whether your loss of license under these Terms was intentional or unintentional. If you want to delete your personal data, as described in Privacy Policy, you will permanently lose all of your Virtual Items without the right to refund, since it will not be possible to associate such Virtual Items with you.
